# Week 01
# _Theory of Inference_

### Goals
1. Understand the motivation behind inference.
2. Appreciate the similarities and differences between Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to inference.
3. Know how to manipulate probability distributions.

## Labs

* `01a_Central_Limit_Theorem.ipynb` experiment with the CLT
* `01b_coin_flips.ipynb` run a really simple Bayesian model with stan; see if Bayes' theorem agrees with your intuition
* `01c_elevator_repair.ipynb` run another simple model, but use it to optimize decisions
