# Week 01: Intro to Inference

## Goals


## Labs

* `01a_Central_Limit_Theorem.ipynb` experiment with the CLT
* `01b_coin_flips.ipynb` run a really simple Bayesian model with stan; see if Bayes' theorem agrees with your intuition
* `01c_elevator_repair.ipynb` run another simple model, but use it to optimize decisions
