### Goals
1. Familiarity with applying Bayes rule to real data.
2. Knowledge of how prior and likelihood interact to form posterior.
3. Experience choosing priors and conducting prior predictive checks.
4. Build foundation for summarizing the posterior.
5. Experience writing conclusions from Bayesian models.

## Labs

1. Work on math score data from the 1980's.
2. Estimate models on [English Premier League data](https://github.com/stan-dev/stancon_talks/tree/master/2017/Contributed-Talks/02_kharratzadeh).
