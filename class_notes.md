# A class on Bayesian Statistics using Stan

A list of topics for an 8 week course on Bayesian statistics that takes you from understanding probability to multilevel modeling in Stan. The main reference is _A Student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics_ by Ben Lambert. Below are links to additional book and course references, including links to freely available lectures on YouTube.

## Course Outline by Week

### Course goals
1. Understand the basic theory and motivation of Bayesian inference.
2. Know how to critically assess a statistical model.
3. Appreciate why we often need to use sampling in Bayesian inference.
4. Grasp how modern MCMC algorithms work intuitively and how to implement these in practice.
5. Know how to code up most models in Stan.
6. Recognize the benefits of multilevel models and how these can be used to provide robust inferences.

### Why Bayes?
1. Simple and intuitive model building (unlike frequentist statistics there is no need to remember lots of specific formulae).
2. Exhaustive and creative model testing.
3. Straightforward interpretation of results.
4. Bayes rule is the only method to invert the probability of the data given a hypothesis that is consistent with the logic of probability.


### Informed interactions with data

>  Blind allegiance to theory or unequivocal adherence to data will not deliver useful knowledge. Optimal gains in knowledge can only occur when we engage in an informed dialogue with data
>  Todd D. Little
