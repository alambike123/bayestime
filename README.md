This course provides an 8-week journey from the basics of probability to being proficient in a modern Bayesian statistical workflow using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). Throughout the course students will complete cycles of the workflow, successively learning more about the bits and pieces. Lectures provide the intuition and theory underpinning a part of the process, and computer labs provide the opportunity to apply this newly acquired knowledge in a series of experiments and challenges.

The course largely borrows material from existing online courses and YouTube videos and includes a series of computational exercises in Stan, Python, and R.
* Each week's material is contained in a folder `XX`.
* Class notes for the week are in markdown files named `week_XX.md`
* Python and R computer labs are in Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown files.
* The Python environment required to run the labs is specified in `environment.yml`
* The R environment required to run the labs is specified in `XXX.yml`
